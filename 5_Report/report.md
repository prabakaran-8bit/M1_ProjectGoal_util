## DESCRIPTION:  
The numeric calculator project is the application based mini project, which is used to perform mathematical claculations by taking input of user. The tool used for writing the code in this project is visual studio code. This project has multi file and multiplatform approach (Linux and Windows).

## RESEARCH

People who don't know how to perform mathematical calculations in mind can or who is not fast in solving the mathematical calculations can use this calculator for personal benefits, however, the defining features of an numeric calculator include:

* accuracy in calculation
* faster than human mind in performing
* time reduced in manually calculating the problems


In addition, high-end numeric calculators generally include:

* factorial
* square ,qube, square root
* basic problem solving addition division subtraction multiplication
### Cost Vs Timeline ** This is the plot of cost of the calculators in ($ ) and time in years

## Defining System:

Design and testing operations of calculator using unit testing algorithm.

## SWOT analysis:

### Strengths: Innovative, User-friendly.

### Weakness: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.

### Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. So tech based market always attracts the youth.

### Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.

## 4’W and 1’H

### What: numeric calculator**

### Where: School,domestic,Technology

### When: Need for calculation.

### How: Calculates the user input as numbers .

## Detailed Requirements:

## High Level Requirements:
* Implemented calculation method square and qube	
* Implemented  calculation method fatorial
* Implemented square root
